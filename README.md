### Usage

In this code have used two entities called Student and Course, entities have a @ManyToMany relationship with each other. You can see this relationship below:

Course.java : 

```java
@ManyToMany(targetEntity = Student.class, mappedBy = "courses",
        cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.DETACH,CascadeType.MERGE,
                CascadeType.REFRESH})
private List<Student> students;
```

Student.java:

```java
@ManyToMany(targetEntity = Course.class, cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.DETACH,CascadeType.MERGE,CascadeType.REFRESH} )
@JoinTable(
        name="t_student_courses",
        joinColumns=
        @JoinColumn( name="student_id", referencedColumnName="id"),
inverseJoinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="course_id", referencedColumnName="id"))
private List<Course> courses;
```

In Postman ( [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) ) you have to type the following statements: 

- **For see all students :**

  (../student/all)

- **For see courses of student has with given id:**

  (../student/{id}/courses)

- **For update student with given id :**

  (../student/update/{id})

- **For create new student :**

  (../student/create)

- **For delete student with given id :**

  (../student/delete/{id})

##### For test and manipulate Course Entity : 

- **For see all courses :**

  (../courses/all)

- **For see students of course has with given id:**

  (../courses/{id}/students)

- **For update course with given id :**

  (../courses/update/{id})
